Course 2: Designing better trials: Advanced randomization methods for modern clinical research 
</h3>

**Course Tutors**: Randomisation Working Group lead by [Alex Sverdlov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-sverdlov-a403167/) (Novartis)

**Time**: 1st June 2026, 2 pm- 5:30 pm <br/>

**Location**: Stephenson Building, Newcastle University


**Course summary**: Modern clinical trials increasingly demand sophisticated randomization methods to efficiently investigate multiple treatments across diverse patient populations while adhering to stringent regulatory requirements. This intensive one-day short course offers hands-on training in state-of-the-art restricted randomization designs, equipping participants with the practical skills and conceptual understanding necessary for designing and implementing robust clinical trials. We will delve into various restricted randomization techniques, including those crucial for multi-arm and platform trials, clearly defining their mechanisms and demonstrating their advantages over traditional methods like permuted block randomization. A substantial part of the course will introduce Response-Adaptive Randomization (RAR) designs, focusing on their suitable applications and, critically, current regulatory perspectives and pathways for their acceptance, while acknowledging the time constraints for extensive hands-on simulation. Participants will gain practical experience through computer code examples using established statistical software (e.g., randomizeR; Incertus.jl) and case studies, empowering them to select and implement fit-for-purpose randomization methods to achieve higher statistical efficiency and more ethical clinical trials.
